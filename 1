Short answers for the below questions suffice. If you want to alter your plan for your project (and obtain approval for the same), be sure to email your section leader directly!


#### What have you done for your project so far?


We have uploaded images of Pokemon Cards and figured out how to display them. We have also randomized the display by using functions we have learned in class (dice roll). We have experimented with coding different games, such as tic-tac-toe and checkers, however we still need to work out some kinks. We have also written most of the python quiz questions that will be embedded within the game! 


#### What have you not done for your project yet?


We have not connected the Pokemon random generator code to a game yet. The point of this generator is so that if a player wins, they randomly get a Pokemon card that will be added to their collection! We also want to code one or two more games and have the user input which games they want to play. 


#### What problems, if any, have you encountered?


It took us a while to understand how to download and use pygame, as neither of us have used it before. However, once this was understood, we were able to really begin our project. We also ran into a few problems trying to make a website utilizing HTML, CSS, and Python, as we realized that the three languages are not easily compatible with each other and using them together requires a difficult approach.
